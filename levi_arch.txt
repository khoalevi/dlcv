common input layer sizes include 
    32 × 32, 64 × 64, 96 × 96, 224 × 224, 227 × 227 and 229 × 229

the input layer should also 
    be divisible by two multiple times after the first CONV operation is applied

your CONV layers should 
    use smaller filter sizes such as 3×3 and 5×5

also commonly 
    use a stride of S = 1 for CONV layers, at least for smaller spatial input volumes

personal preference is to 
    apply zero-padding to CONV layers

personal recommendation is to 
    use POOL layers (rather than CONV layers) to reduce the spatial dimensions of input

most commonly, max pooling 
    applied over a 2×2 receptive field size and a stride of S = 2

recommend 
    using BN in nearly all situations

consider 
    applying dropout in nearly every architecture


Levi's Arch v1:

    INPUT => [[CONV => RELU => BN] * N => POOL?] * M => [FC => RELU => DO] * K => SOFTMAX

    0 <= N <= 3
    M >= 0
    0 <= K <= 2
